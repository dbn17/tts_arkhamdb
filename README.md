This is a tool to download content from ArkhamDB and from this generate a Tabletop Simulator Savegame.
Goal is to consistently setup a savegame/workshop item without need of manual clicks in TTS.

Status

Nothing too fancy yet, but:

 - Caching of ArkhamDB content
 - Custom Table is setup

 - Cards for select expansions are bagged and put on the table
